# Flutter Training Resources

This repository contains curated resources and hands-on exercises for Flutter and Dart training. It is organized as a mono-workspace with two primary areas:

- `practice-dart/` — standalone Dart language exercises and small console projects.
- `practice-flutter/` — multiple small Flutter apps focusing on specific widgets and concepts.

## Repository structure

- `practice-dart/`
  - Topic folders (e.g., `01-basics`, `02-types`, `03-control-flow`, `04-collections`, `05-nullsafety`, `06-functions`, `07-advanced-functions`, `08-classes`, `09-classes-advanced`, `10-mixins-and-extensions`)
    - Each contains one or more `.dart` files to illustrate the topic.
  - Mini-projects:
    - `project-01/rock_scissor_paper/main.dart` — simple RPS game (CLI).
    - `project-02/data_analysis/` — CSV sample (`shopping_list.csv`) and `total.dart` for basic parsing/aggregation.
    - `project-03/ecommerce/` — Dart package layout with `bin/` and `lib/` demonstrating package structure and tests.
- `practice-flutter/`
  - `pf_01_first_ugly_app/` — very first MaterialApp + Scaffold + FAB demo.
  - `pf_02_stateless_widget/` — intro to StatelessWidget and composition.
  - `pf_03_image_app/` — working with assets (`assets/images/`) and network images.
  - `pf_04_button_widget/` — TextButton, ElevatedButton, OutlinedButton, IconButton, and FAB.
  - Each Flutter app is a self-contained project with its own `pubspec.yaml`.

> Note: Some Flutter projects include platform folders (android, ios, web, macos, linux, windows). These are generated by Flutter and can be re-generated if needed.

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK 3.10+
- Flutter SDK (stable channel recommended)
- A recent Xcode/Android Studio setup if you plan to run on iOS/Android

Verify installations:

```bash
# Dart & Flutter versions
dart --version
flutter --version
```

## Getting started

- Clone the repo and open it in your IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ with Flutter plugin).
- You can work on Dart or Flutter sections independently.

### Working with Dart exercises (`practice-dart/`)

- Run a single file example:

```bash
# Example: run a topic file
dart run practice-dart/04-collections/lists.dart
```

- Run a project entrypoint:

```bash
# Rock/Scissor/Paper
dart run practice-dart/project-01/rock_scissor_paper/main.dart

# Data analysis
dart run practice-dart/project-02/data_analysis/total.dart
```

- Run a package-style project (e.g., ecommerce):

```bash
cd practice-dart/project-03/ecommerce
dart pub get
dart run bin/ecommerce.dart
# Optionally run tests if present
dart test
```

### Working with Flutter apps (`practice-flutter/`)

Each subfolder is its own Flutter app. Typical workflow:

```bash
cd practice-flutter/pf_03_image_app
flutter pub get
flutter run  # choose a device from the prompt
```

- Hot reload: press `r` in the `flutter run` terminal; hot restart: `R`.
- To specify a platform:

```bash
# Web (requires web support enabled)
flutter run -d chrome

# iOS simulator
flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator
flutter run -d ios

# Android emulator (example device id)
flutter emulators --launch Pixel_7_Pro_API_35
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

## Notable examples

- `pf_01_first_ugly_app/lib/main.dart` — shows basic `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `FAB`, and logging.
- `pf_03_image_app/lib/main.dart` — mixes `AssetImage`, `NetworkImage`, and `Icon` usage with a simple layout.
- `pf_04_button_widget/lib/main.dart` — demonstrates different button widgets and styling patterns.
- `project-03/ecommerce/` — illustrates a simple Dart package structure (`pubspec.yaml`, `bin/`, `lib/`).

## Adding new exercises

- Dart example:
  1. Create a new `.dart` file under the appropriate `practice-dart/<topic>/` folder.
  2. Keep the file self-contained with a `main()` entrypoint for easy `dart run` execution.

- Flutter app:
  1. Create a new Flutter project inside `practice-flutter/`:

```bash
cd practice-flutter
flutter create pf_05_new_topic_app
```

  2. Edit `pubspec.yaml` to add assets or dependencies.
  3. Implement features in `lib/` and run with `flutter run`.

## Common commands

```bash
# Upgrade dependencies for a given project
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions

# Check dependency updates (Flutter or Dart)
flutter pub outdated
# or (inside a Dart package)
dart pub outdated

# Static analysis (Flutter)
flutter analyze

# Format code (Dart & Flutter)
dart format .
```

## Troubleshooting

- If asset images do not load in `pf_03_image_app`, ensure the path is declared in `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter.assets` and that the folder exists (e.g., `assets/images/logo.png`). Then run `flutter pub get` and hot restart.
- If Flutter cannot find a device, launch an emulator/simulator or connect a physical device:

```bash
flutter devices
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
```

- If iOS build fails on first run, open the iOS project in Xcode once to complete signing/setup.

## Conventions

- Keep examples minimal, focused on a single concept.
- Use clear naming for apps: `pf_<nn>_<topic>_app`.
- Prefer `flutter_lints`/`lints` and keep code formatted with `dart format`.
