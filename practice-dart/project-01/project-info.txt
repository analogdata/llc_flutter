Rock, Paper or Scissors ? (r/p/s)


It should read the user input and use it as follows:

- If the user enters "r", "p", or "s", it should print "You chose rock", "You chose paper", or "You chose scissors" respectively. Choose as valid move.
- If the user enters anything else, it should print "Invalid move".
- If the user enters "q", it should print "Goodbye" and exit the program.

After the user makes a choice, the program should generate a random choice, then compare the choices according to the rules of the game (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock) and print the result.

The program should continue running until the user enters "q".

For example: If the user enters "r", the program should print "You chose rock" and then print "Computer chose paper" and then print "You lose".

> You chose rock
> Computer chose paper
> You lose

The program should continue running until the user enters "q".

> Rock, Paper or Scissors ? (r/p/s)
> q
> Goodbye
