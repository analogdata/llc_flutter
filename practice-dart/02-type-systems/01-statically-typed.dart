void main() {

  // What is Statically Typed Programming Language ?
  // Statically Typed Programming Language is a programming language where the type of a variable is known at compile time
  // Example: Java, C, C++, C#, TypeScript, Dart, Golang, Rust

  // What is Dynamically Typed Programming Language ?
  // Dynamically Typed Programming Language is a programming language where the type of a variable is known at runtime
  // Example: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js

  int a = 10;
  print(a);

  // a = "Hello World"; // Error because a is of type int cannot be changed to String
  // print(a);

  // Why Static languages are better than Dynamic languages ?
  // 1. Static languages are faster than Dynamic languages
  // 2. Static languages are more secure than Dynamic languages
  // 3. Static languages are more maintainable than Dynamic languages
  // 4. Static languages are more readable than Dynamic languages
  // 5. Static languages are more scalable than Dynamic languages
  // 6. Static languages are more portable than Dynamic languages
  // 7. Static languages are more extensible than Dynamic languages
